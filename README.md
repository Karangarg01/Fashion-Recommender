## AI-Powered Fashion Recommendation System

FitTrend Recommender is a machine learning-based web application that allows users to discover similar clothing items by uploading a photo. The system uses deep learning and computer vision to analyze the uploaded image and recommend the top 5 most visually similar fashion items from a database.

## Key Features
- **Upload an Image**: Upload a photo of a fashion item (e.g., dress, shirt, or shoes).
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: The system analyzes the visual features of the image and finds similar items.
- **Top 5 Recommendations**: Get a list of the 5 most visually similar fashion items hosted on Cloudinary.
- **Interactive UI**: Easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit for seamless interaction.

---

## How It Works
1. **Upload an Image**: The user uploads an image of a fashion item.
2. **Feature Extraction**: The system uses ResNet50, a pre-trained deep learning model, to extract visual features from the uploaded image.
3. **Database Comparison**: These features are then compared to a precomputed database of fashion items using cosine similarity.
4. **Recommendations**: The system returns the top 5 most similar items from the database.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras (ResNet50 for feature extraction)
- **Similarity Calculation**: Scikit-learn (Cosine Similarity)
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit (for interactive user interface)
- **Cloud Hosting**: Cloudinary (for hosting fashion items database)
- **Version Control**: Git LFS (for handling large files)
